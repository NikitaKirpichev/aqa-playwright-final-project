Final project for AQA internship

To run Amazon tests, you need to create a file amazon-credentials.const.ts in src/constants, which looks like:
```
export const EMAIL = 'example@gmail.com' //replace by yours email
export const PASSWORD = 'example' //replace by yours password 
```

To run VK-api tests, you need to create a file vk-token.const.ts in src/constants, which looks like:

export const ACCESS_TOKEN = '' /replace by yours VK token, that has access to the wall
```
